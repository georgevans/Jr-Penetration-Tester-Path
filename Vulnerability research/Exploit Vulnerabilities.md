# Room: Exploit Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability Scanners

- Tools used to quickly canvass applications for flaws.
- Range from **commercial (expensive)** to **open-source/free**.
- Example: **Nessus**
 - Free (community) edition available.
 - Commercial version costs thousands per year.
 - Common in penetration testing services/audits.

### Advantages vs Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Automated scans are repeatable, results easy to share. | Over-reliance on tools. |
| Quick and efficient across many applications. | Very "loud" â€“ lots of traffic/logging, easily detected. |
| Open-source options exist. | Open-source tools often basic; advanced features require costly licenses. |
| Covers wide range of vulnerabilities. | Will not detect every vulnerability. |

## Manual Scanning

- Preferred by penetration testers for individual applications.
- Uses **similar techniques as automated scanning**, but with human oversight.
- Often more accurate, avoids false positives/negatives.

## Common Vulnerability Types

| Vulnerability | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Security Misconfigurations** | Caused by developer oversight (e.g., exposing server info in messages). |
| **Broken Access Control** | Attacker gains access to areas they should not have. |
| **Insecure Deserialization** | Unsafe processing of user-supplied data; can allow malicious code execution. |
| **Injection** | Malicious input is not sanitised, allowing attacker to manipulate application behaviour. |

## Finding Exploits

### Rapid7

- Functions as both **vulnerability** and **exploit database**.
- Includes instructions for exploitation using **Metasploit**.
- Example: Wordpress Plugin exploit with direct Metasploit usage guide.

### GitHub

- Originally for developers, but also widely used by security researchers.
- Hosts **PoCs (Proof of Concepts)** for vulnerabilities.
- Strengths:
 - Easy upload, fresh/rare exploits.
 - Searchable via tags/keywords (`PoC`, `vulnerability`, `CVE`).
- Weaknesses:
 - No verification process.
 - PoCs may not work and have little/no support.

### Searchsploit

- Offline tool included in **Kali Linux** and **AttackBox**.
- Local copy of **Exploit-DB**.
- Can search exploits by application name or vulnerability type.
- Example search:
    ```bash
    searchsploit wordpress
    WordPress Theme Think Responsive 1.0 - Arbitr | php/webapps/29332.txt
    WordPress Theme This Way - 'upload_settings_i | php/webapps/38820.php
    WordPress Theme Toolbox - 'mls' SQL Injection | php/webapps/38077.txt
    ...
```
- Allows use of exploits **without downloading** from the internet.
