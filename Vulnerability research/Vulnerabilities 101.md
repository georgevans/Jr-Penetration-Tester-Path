# Room: Vulnerabilities 101

## What is a Vulnerability?

- A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in the design, implementation, or behaviour of a system or application.
- Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to:
 - Gain unauthorised access.
 - Perform unauthorised actions.

**Example definition (NIST):**
A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.

Vulnerabilities may come from:
- Poor application design.
- Misconfigurations.
- User mistakes/oversight.

## Categories of Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Operating System** | Found within OSs; often leads to privilege escalation. |
| **(Mis)Configuration-based** | Caused by misconfigured apps/services (e.g., site exposing customer details). |
| **Weak or Default Credentials** | Default usernames/passwords (e.g., admin/admin). Easy to guess. |
| **Application Logic** | Poorly designed apps (e.g., broken authentication). |
| **Human-Factor** | Exploits human behaviour (e.g., phishing). |

## Vulnerability Management & Scoring

- **Vulnerability management** = evaluating, categorising, and remediating threats.
- Not all vulnerabilities can (or should) be patched.
- Only ~2% of vulnerabilities are ever exploited (Kenna Security, 2020).
- Goal: **Focus on the most dangerous vulnerabilities**.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

- Introduced **2005**; currently at **CVSSv3.1** (v4.0 in draft).
- Factors include:
 1. Ease of exploitation.
 2. Availability of exploits.
 3. Impact on the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

### Severity Ratings

| Rating | Score Range |
|--------|-------------|
| None | 0 |
| Low | 0.1 – 3.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 – 6.9 |
| High | 7.0 – 8.9 |
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0 |

### CVSS Pros & Cons

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Long-standing and widely used. | Not designed for prioritisation, only severity. |
| Recommended by NIST, free to use. | Heavy reliance on exploit availability (only ~20% have exploits). |
| Familiar in many organisations. | Scores rarely change even if new exploits appear. |

## Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR)

- Developed by **Tenable** (modern, risk-driven approach).
- Focuses on **organisational risk**, not just impact.
- Dynamic scoring → risk changes daily as vulnerabilities age.
- Considers **relevancy** → ignores vulnerabilities irrelevant to the org.

### Severity Ratings

| Rating | Score Range |
|--------|-------------|
| Low | 0.0 – 3.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 – 6.9 |
| High | 7.0 – 8.9 |
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0 |

### VPR Pros & Cons

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Real-world, modern framework. | Not open-source. |
| Considers 150+ risk factors. | Only available in commercial platforms. |
| Risk-driven, helps prioritise patching. | CIA triad less central to scoring. |
| Scores update dynamically as threats evolve. | – |

## Vulnerability Databases

- Track & catalogue known vulnerabilities.
- Two key resources:

### 1. **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**
- Lists all publicly categorised vulnerabilities as **CVEs**.
- Format: `CVE-YEAR-ID` (e.g., `CVE-2017-0144` – WannaCry).
- Good for tracking **all confirmed CVEs**, but not app-specific exploitation.

### 2. **Exploit-DB**
- More useful for **offensive security & pentesting**.
- Stores **exploits** and **PoC code**.
- Organised by software, author, and version.
- Great resource for real-world attack demonstrations.

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Vulnerability** | Weakness/flaw in a system/app. |
| **Exploit** | An action/tool that uses a vulnerability. |
| **Proof of Concept (PoC)** | Demonstrates exploitation of a vulnerability. |
